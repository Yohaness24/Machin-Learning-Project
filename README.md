# Machin-Learning-Project
Python-based machine learning algorithm to predict the prices of the houses in Washington D.C
The dataset for this project is in the file Housing.csv
The dataset consists of real property information, including the most recent sales price as of July 2018, for
properties located in Washington, D.C.

The total number of rows in the file is approximately 160,000. There are forty-nine columns (features)
for each data point. Not every data point is complete; there are missing values in some of the rows.
For this project, to make the data size more manageable, we will focus only on the data with
SOURCE=’Residential’. This will reduce the data size to about 107,000 rows.

The objective is to be able to develop predictive models based on the given data that will allow us to
make predictions about the price of housing
